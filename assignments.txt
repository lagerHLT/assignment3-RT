1.1 The priority ordering for task set T is T1, T2 och T3.
1.2 Yes they will. Utilization bound: ~0.75%
1.3 Yes they will. Utilization bound: ~0.95%
1.4 No they won't. Utilization bound: ~1.05%
1.5 No they won't. Utilization bound: ~0.95%
1.6 Our conclusiion is that if the Utilization bound is lower than the specific utilization we have a guarantee that
the tasks will finish. If the Utilization bound is between this value and 1.00 however, we don't have any guarantee but it might finsih anyway. If above 1.00 the tasks can't finish before the deadline.
1.7 WCRT: T1 = 2.0, T2 = 6.0, T3 = 24.0. 
Instances of T1 = 3, T2 = 2.
How does this relate: Expressio0n tells us how many times the period for task j fits into our response times.
T3 spends 14ms waiting (6ms for T1 and 8ms for T2). qw12 00,0

2.1 Priority ordering RM: T2, T3, T1, T4 (does not finish due to T1)
Priority ordering DM: T1, T2, T3, T4 (All tasks finish) 
2.2 One that works: T2, T1, T3, T4
One that doesn't work: T4, T1, T2, T3 
2.3 WCRT: T1 = 2.0, T2 = 10.0, T3 = 10.0, T4 = 54.0.
No. T2 misses the deadline. T1 and T4 are not affected. If we combine T2 and T3 computation time it exceeds T2 deadline. So if T3 is executed first, T2 will miss its deadline.

3.3 Response Times: 
RespTime[T1] = 2.200000
RespTime[T2] = 5.600000
RespTime[T3] = 17.800000
RespTime[T4] = 518.000000

T3 and T4 misses their deadlines

4.1 yes according to schedulability formula.
